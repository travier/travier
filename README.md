# Timoth√©e Ravier (Siosm)

Hi there! üëã I am a Linux üêß system and security engineer interested in safe
programming languages ü¶Ä and container focused operating systems üì¶.

## CoreOS engineering

I am currently a member of the CoreOS team at [Red Hat], working on [Fedora
CoreOS] and [Red Hat CoreOS].

CoreOS systems are all about running containers at scale with [Kubernetes]
distributions ([OpenShift], [OKD], [Typhoon]) or on a single server with
[podman].

[See talks about Fedora CoreOS](talks.md#fedora-coreos).

## Fedora Kinoite

[Fedora Kinoite] is a container focused desktop operating system featuring the
[KDE Plasma desktop] and based on [rpm-ostree], [podman] and [Flatpak]. [Fedora
Kinoite] is a close sibling of [Fedora Silverblue], which is based on the same
core technologies and features the [GNOME desktop]. Fedora Kinoite is available
as part of the Fedora Project (first released with Fedora 35).

I also used to maintain unofficial builds based on Fedora 34 and older for
Fedora Kinoite and other variants (XFCE, LXQt, Deepin, Mate and Pantheon). See
[this Fedora Magazine article][KinoiteArticle] and [this Fedora Discussion
thread][KinoiteThread] for details.

[See talks about Fedora Kinoite](talks.md#fedora-kinoite).

## Flatpaks

To increase the number of applications available as [Flatpaks][Flatpak] for
[rpm-ostree] based systems (Silverblue & Kinoite), I am working on packaging as
many [KDE applications] as possible in Flatpaks for [Flathub] and Fedora (still
in progress, coming latter).
