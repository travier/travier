Hi there! üëã I am a Linux üêß system and security engineer interested in safe
programming languages ü¶Ä and container focused operating systems üì¶.

## CoreOS engineering

I am currently a member of the CoreOS team at [Red Hat], working on [Fedora
CoreOS] and [Red Hat CoreOS].

CoreOS systems are all about running containers at scale with [Kubernetes]
distributions ([OpenShift], [OKD], [Typhoon]) or on a single server with
[podman].

### Talks

- Fedora CoreOS, un syst√®me con√ßu pour faire tourner au mieux vos containers,
  France DevOps Nov. 2021 ([video][FDO2021v] & [slides][FDO2021s])
- What's new and what's next in Fedora CoreOS, Nest with Fedora 2021
  ([video][NwFCOS2021v] & [slides][NwFCOS2021s])
- Fedora CoreOS, a container focused OS to securely deploy and run
  applications, Pass the SALT 2021 ([video & slides][PtS2021])
- Fedora CoreOS or Fedora IoT? Containers Plumbing Days 2021 ([video][CPD2021v]
  & [slides][CPD2021s])
- Let's Talk About Fedora CoreOS, OpenShift TV ([video][OSTVv] &
  [slides][OSTVs])

## Fedora Kinoite

[Fedora Kinoite] is a container focused desktop operating system featuring the
[KDE Plasma desktop] and based on [rpm-ostree], [podman] and [Flatpak]. [Fedora
Kinoite] is a close sibling of [Fedora Silverblue], which is based on the same
core technologies and features the [GNOME desktop]. The first stable release of
Fedora Kinoite is now available as part of the Fedora 35 release.

I also used to maintain unofficial builds based on Fedora 34 and older for
Fedora Kinoite and other variants (XFCE, LXQt, Deepin, Mate and Pantheon). See
[this Fedora Magazine article][KinoiteArticle] and [this Fedora Discussion
thread][KinoiteThread] for details.

### Talks

- Introducing Kinoite: a new Fedora variant featuring the KDE Plasma desktop,
  Nest with Fedora 2021 ([video][NwFK2021v] & [slides][NwFK2021s])
- Introducing Kinoite: a new Fedora variant featuring the KDE Plasma desktop,
  Akademy 2021 ([video][Akademy2021v] & [slides][Akademy2021s])

## Flatpaks

To increase the number of applications available as [Flatpaks][Flatpak] for
[rpm-ostree] based systems (Silverblue & Kinoite), I am working on packaging as
many [KDE applications] as possible in Flatpaks for [Flathub] and Fedora (still
in progress, coming latter).
