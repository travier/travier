# Timoth√©e Ravier (Siosm)

Hi there! üëã I am a Linux üêß system and security engineer interested in safe
programming languages ü¶Ä and container focused operating systems üì¶.

## CoreOS engineering

I am currently a member of the CoreOS team at [Red Hat], working on [Fedora
CoreOS] and [Red Hat CoreOS].

CoreOS systems are all about running containers at scale with [Kubernetes]
distributions ([OpenShift], [OKD], [Typhoon]) or on a single server with
[podman].

[See talks about Fedora CoreOS and CentOS Stream CoreOS](talks.md#fedora-coreos-and-centos-stream-coreos).

## Fedora Kinoite

[Fedora Kinoite] is a container focused desktop operating system featuring the
[KDE Plasma desktop] and based on [rpm-ostree], [podman] and [Flatpak]. [Fedora
Kinoite] is a close sibling of [Fedora Silverblue], which is based on the same
core technologies and features the [GNOME desktop]. Fedora Kinoite is available
as part of the Fedora Project (first released with Fedora 35). I am a
maintainer for those Fedora variants.

Alongside the official Fedora Kinoite variant, I maintain unofficial variants,
Kinoite Beta and Kinoite Nightly, that are respectively including KDE Beta and
Nightly packages on top of stable Fedora in order to make it easier to test the
latest changes in the KDE Plasma desktop environment. See [Introducing Kinoite
Nightly (and Kinoite Beta)][KinoiteNightly] for more details.

[See talks about Fedora Kinoite](talks.md#fedora-kinoite-and-flatpaks).

## KDE Apps as Flatpaks

[rpm-ostree] based desktop systems (Silverblue, Kinoite, etc.) use
[Flatpaks][Flatpak] to make graphical applications easily available to users. I
maintain [KDE applications] Flatpaks in [Flathub] and am working on packaging
and fixing the missing ones.

[See talks about Flatpaks](talks.md#fedora-kinoite-and-flatpaks).

## Toolbox (and distrobox) images

To make it easier to run various popular distributions with [toolbox] or
[distrobox], I have created a community maintained repository to share the
maintenance of container images:
[toolbx-images](https://github.com/toolbx-images/images). See [Community
maintained images for toolbox (and
distrobox)](https://tim.siosm.fr/blog/2022/12/05/toolbx-community-images/) for
more details.
