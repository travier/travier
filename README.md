# Timoth√©e Ravier (Siosm)

Hi there! üëã I am a Linux üêß system and security engineer interested in safe
programming languages ü¶Ä and container focused operating systems üì¶.

## CoreOS engineering

I am currently a member of the CoreOS team at [Red Hat], working on [Fedora
CoreOS] and [Red Hat Enterprise Linux CoreOS].

CoreOS systems are all about running containers at scale with [Kubernetes]
distributions ([OpenShift], [OKD], [Typhoon]) or on a single server with
[podman] and [quadlet].

[See talks about Fedora CoreOS and CentOS Stream CoreOS](talks.md#fedora-coreos-and-centos-stream-coreos).

## Fedora Atomic Desktops (Silverblue, Kinoite, etc.)

I am a maintainer of the [Fedora Atomic Desktops]. They are container focused
desktop operating systems based on [rpm-ostree], [podman] and [Flatpak]. I
primarily maintain the [Silverblue] and [Kinoite] variants which respectively
feature the [GNOME] and [KDE Plasma] desktops environments.

The [Fedora Atomic Desktops] are also the base for the [Universal Blue] images
([Aurora], [Bazzite], [Bluefin]) that include drivers (NVIDIA), codecs and
other changes that we can not include in Fedora, generally for legal reasons. I
recommend giving them a try if your hardware requires this kind of support.

[See talks about Fedora Atomic Desktops](talks.md#fedora-atomic-desktops-and-flatpaks).

## KDE Apps as Flatpaks

[Fedora Atomic Desktops] systems (Silverblue, Kinoite, etc.) use
[Flatpaks][Flatpak] to make graphical applications easily available to users. I
am part of the team that maintains the [KDE applications] Flatpaks in
[Flathub]. I am also looking at packaging the missing ones and improving the
integration in KDE Invent and KDE development in general.

[See talks about Flatpaks](talks.md#fedora-atomic-desktops-and-flatpaks).

## Toolbox (and distrobox) images

To make it easier to run various popular distributions with [toolbox] or
[distrobox], I have created a community maintained repository to share the
maintenance of container images:
[toolbx-images](https://github.com/toolbx-images/images). See [Community
maintained images for toolbox (and
distrobox)](https://tim.siosm.fr/blog/2022/12/05/toolbx-community-images/) for
more details.

## Systemd system extensions (sysexts)

To be able to safely extend CoreOS and Atomic Desktop systems without resorting
to package layering or derivation, I am working on creating systemd system
extensions (sysexts) for various common use cases. Those sysexts are currently
experimental and unofficial, but should be usable and stable. See the
[fedora-sysexts] repo. I am also working on a more ergonimic user experience
for managing those sysexts with the [sysexts-manager] project.
