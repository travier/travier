Hello there, I am a Linux system and security engineer interested in safe
programming languages and container focused operating systems.

## Red Hat & Fedora CoreOS

I am currently a Red Hat and Fedora CoreOS engineer (see my
[GitHub profile](https://github.com/travier)).

CoreOS systems are all about running containers at scale with
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) distributions
([OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com), [OKD](https://www.okd.io),
[Typhoon](https://typhoon.psdn.io)) or on a single server with
[podman](https://podman.io).

## Fedora Silverblue

[Fedora Silverblue](https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org) is a container
focused desktop operating system based on
[rpm-ostree](https://rpm-ostree.readthedocs.io), [podman](https://podman.io)
and [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org).

I maintain an unofficial project nicknamed
[Kinoite](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/kinoite-a-kde-and-now-xfce-version-of-fedora-silverblue/147)
that provide variants based on the KDE, XFCE, LXQt, Deepin, Mate and Pantheon
desktop environments.

## Flatpaks

To help Silverblue systems run applications in [Flatpaks](https://flatpak.org),
I am working on packaging as many
[KDE applications](https://kde.org/applications) as possible in Flatpaks for
[Flathub](https://flathub.org/home) and Fedora (in progress, coming latter).
