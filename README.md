Hello there, I am a Linux system and security engineer interested in safe
programming languages and container focused operating systems.

## Red Hat & Fedora CoreOS

I am currently a Red Hat and Fedora CoreOS engineer (see my
[GitHub profile](https://github.com/travier)).

CoreOS systems are all about running containers at scale with
[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) distributions
([OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com), [OKD](https://www.okd.io),
[Typhoon](https://typhoon.psdn.io)) or on a single server with
[podman](https://podman.io).

## Fedora Kinoite (Fedora Silverblue variant)

Fedora Kinoite is a container focused desktop operating system featuring the
[KDE Plasma desktop](https://kde.org) and based on
[rpm-ostree](https://coreos.github.io/rpm-ostree/), [podman](https://podman.io)
and [Flatpak](https://flatpak.org). Fedora Kinoite is a variant of
[Fedora Silverblue](https://silverblue.fedoraproject.org).

Fedora Kinoite will has been
[accepted as a change for the Fedora 35 release](https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Changes/Fedora_Kinoite)
and will be included soon in Rawhide. In the meantime, I maintain unofficial
builds for Fedora Kinoite and other variants (XFCE, LXQt, Deepin, Mate and
Pantheon). See
[this Fedora Magazine article](https://fedoramagazine.org/discover-fedora-kinoite/) and
[this Fedora Discussion thread](https://discussion.fedoraproject.org/t/kinoite-a-kde-and-now-xfce-version-of-fedora-silverblue/147)
for details.

## Flatpaks

To help Silverblue systems run applications in [Flatpaks](https://flatpak.org),
I am working on packaging as many
[KDE applications](https://kde.org/applications) as possible in Flatpaks for
[Flathub](https://flathub.org/home) and Fedora (in progress, coming latter).
