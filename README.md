Hi there! üëã I am a Linux üêß system and security engineer interested in safe
programming languages ü¶Ä and container focused operating systems üì¶.

## CoreOS engineering

I am currently a member of the CoreOS team at Red Hat, working on Fedora CoreOS
and Red Hat CoreOS (see my [GitHub profile][GitHub]).

CoreOS systems are all about running containers at scale with [Kubernetes]
distributions ([OpenShift], [OKD], [Typhoon]) or on a single server with
[podman].

## Fedora Kinoite

Fedora Kinoite is a container focused desktop operating system featuring the
[KDE Plasma desktop][KDE] and based on [rpm-ostree], [podman] and [Flatpak].
Fedora Kinoite is a close sibling of [Fedora Silverblue][Silverblue], which is
based on the same core technologies and features the [GNOME desktop][GNOME].

Fedora Kinoite has been [accepted officially in Fedora][Change] and will be
released as part of Fedora 35. In the meantime, you can try the official
Rawhide development builds by following the instructions from [this Fedora
Discussion thread][Rawhide].

I also maintain unofficial stable builds based on Fedora 34 for Fedora Kinoite
and other variants (XFCE, LXQt, Deepin, Mate and Pantheon). See [this Fedora
Magazine article][Article] and [this Fedora Discussion thread][Thread] for
details.

## Flatpaks

To increase the number of applications available as [Flatpaks][Flatpak] for
[rpm-ostree] based systems (Silverblue & Kinoite), I am working on packaging as
many [KDE applications][Apps] as possible in Flatpaks for [Flathub] and Fedora
(still in progress, coming latter).
